# Orthogonal moments
Repository containing several implementations for the calculation of Orthogonal Moments
Code implemented by Bob van Nifterik - TU Delft 

- The functions ending XX_ALL.m calculate the moment matrix
- The functions ending XX_R.m calculate the reconstructed image
- The functions ending XX_basis.m calculate the basis function 



For the implementation of the Continuous moments defined on a disk, please see to the work:
