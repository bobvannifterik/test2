# Orthogonal moments
Repository containing several implementations for the calculation of Orthogonal Moments
Code implemented by Bob van Nifterik - TU Delft 

- The functions ending XX_ALL.m calculate the moment matrix
- The functions ending XX_R.m calculate the reconstructed image
- The functions ending XX_basis.m calculate the basis function 


For the calculation, the Jacobi-based moments use: \\
PJFM: p = 4 and q = 3 \\
CHFM: p = 2 and q = 1.5 \\
OFMM: p = 2 and q = 2 \\

For the implementation of the other continuous moments defined on a disk, please see to the work:
