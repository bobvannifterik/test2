# Orthogonal moments
Repository containing several implementations for the calculation of Orthogonal Moments<br />
Code implemented by Bob van Nifterik - TU Delft <br />
<br />
- The functions ending XX_ALL.m calculate the moment matrix<br />
- The functions ending XX_R.m calculate the reconstructed image<br />
- The functions ending XX_basis.m calculate the basis function <br />
<br />

For the calculation, the Jacobi-based moments use: <br />
PJFM: p = 4 and q = 3 <br />
CHFM: p = 2 and q = 1.5 <br />
OFMM: p = 2 and q = 2 <br />

For the implementation of the other continuous moments defined on a disk, please see to the work:<br />
